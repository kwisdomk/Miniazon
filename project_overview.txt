Miniazon: E-Commerce Data Structures Project
Project Overview
Project Title: Miniazon - Data Structures in E-Commerce
Team: [Your Team Name]
Course: [Your Course Name]
Duration: 4-Week Sprint
Tech Stack: Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Bootstrap

Executive Summary
Miniazon is a simplified e-commerce platform designed specifically to demonstrate core data structures and algorithms in a real-world context. Unlike typical web projects, our primary focus is on the implementation and visualization of fundamental computer science concepts rather than commercial features.

📋 Project Specifications
Core Objectives
Implement 4 key data structures from scratch

Demonstrate real-world application of each structure

Analyze time and space complexity

Present clear visualizations of how each structure operates

Technical Requirements
✅ Functional e-commerce website

✅ Custom data structure implementations

✅ Algorithm complexity analysis

✅ RESTful API design

✅ Database integration

✅ Web interface

✅ Documentation and presentation

Data Structure Specifications
1. Inverted Index - For Search
Purpose: Fast product search and retrieval
Implementation: Hash Table + Sets
Operations:

add_product(product_id, text) - O(k) where k = words

search(query) - O(m) where m = query words

get_suggestions(prefix) - O(1) with prefix tree

Real-world analogy: Amazon product search

2. Shopping Cart - Hash Table
Purpose: User session cart management
Implementation: Dictionary of dictionaries
Operations:

add_item(user_id, product_id) - O(1)

remove_item(user_id, product_id) - O(1)

get_cart(user_id) - O(1)

update_quantity(user_id, product_id, quantity) - O(1)

Real-world analogy: Amazon shopping cart

3. Product Graph - Recommendations
Purpose: "Customers who bought this also bought..."
Implementation: Adjacency List
Operations:

add_relationship(product_a, product_b) - O(1)

get_recommendations(product_id, depth=2) - O(V+E)

find_similar_users(user_id) - O(V²) with matrix

Real-world analogy: Amazon recommendation engine

4. Inventory Queue - Stock Management
Purpose: Handle restocking requests and order processing
Implementation: Queue with priority elements
Operations:

add_restock_request(product_id, quantity) - O(1)

process_next_restock() - O(1)

get_urgent_requests() - O(n) for priority

Real-world analogy: Amazon warehouse management
